# Shell Project

## Made by Douglas Davidson and Caleb House

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a simple shell from scratch with limited functions available to us.

## Technologies

We created many functions to make our shell work properly. We made our own versions of putchar, puts, and printf to use for this shell. This allows us to show a prompt for the user to begin typing. This input is then taken and parsed to see if there are any commands found within the $PATH. If this is the case, then it will run that program.

## Examples

We are able to do many things with this shell, inlcuding but not limited to:
`ls` - Lists the non-hidden files and directories in the current directory.\
` ` - Simply typing space and enter, or just enter, simply moves to the next line and shows the prompt again.\
`/bin/pwd` - Prints the working directory.\
`env` - Prints the current environment.\
`exit` - Exits out of the shell.\
